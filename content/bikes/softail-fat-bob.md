Harley-Davidsons are sometimes derided as slow handling or even ponderous, but the 2019 Fat Bob makes a clean break from that mindset. Spirited, agile, and muscular, the former dual-shock-equipped Dyna model represents a seismic shift from The Motor Companyâ€™s traditional V-twin bruiser. H-D designers refer to this bike as one for the zombie apocalypse, and a quick look tells you why. Chunky tires, a unique, horizontally oriented LED headlight, and a bold 2-into-1-into-2 bronze-hue exhaust-pipe treatment identify the Fat Bob as something special, while the rest of the bike receives a darker, more menacing styling treatment.
